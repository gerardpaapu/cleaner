Clean is a utility for making text suitable for inclusion in html, it does a few different things.

- Drops control characters and byte order marks
- Replaces Windows-1252 with (e.g. the "smartquotes" from MS Word) corresponding safe unicode characters
- Replaces all non-ascii characters with numeric xml entities

Usage
---

Calling `racket script.ss -h` will display the usage:

    cleaner [ <option> ... ] [<filenames>] ...
     where <option> is one of
      -s <s>, --suffix <s> : append a suffix to output files
      --help, -h : Show this help
      -- : Do not treat any remaining argument as a switch (at this level)
     Multiple single-letter switches can be combined after one `-'; for
      example: `-h-' is the same as `-h --'

When given a list of files, script.ss will append a suffix to the input file to
decide the name out the output file, the default suffix is '.clean'.

e.g. the clean version of foo.txt will be written to foo.txt.clean

A suffix may be provided using the '-s' flag.

If it is not given a list of files, cleaner reads from stdin and writes to stdout.
